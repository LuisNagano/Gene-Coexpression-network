# Gene Co-expression Network Analysis in Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC)

## Project Overview

This project employs advanced bioinformatics techniques to explore gene co-expression networks in Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC), a rare and aggressive form of cancer affecting the adrenal glands. By leveraging data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we aim to uncover novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ACC and identify potential therapeutic targets.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- TCGA-ACC: Tumor samples classified into three subtypes (COC1, COC2, COC3)
- GTEx: Normal adrenal gland tissue samples

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalized gene expression data using variance stabilizing transformation (VST).
2. **Co-expression Network Construction**: Utilized CEMiTool (Co-Expression Modules identification Tool) to identify gene modules.
3. **Module Characterization**: 
   - Profile plots
   - Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
   - Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)
   - Interaction network analysis

### Key Tools and Libraries
- R programming language
- CEMiTool package
- ggplot2 for visualization

## Results and Insights

### Module Identification
The analysis identified 5 distinct co-expression modules (M1-M5) and a set of uncorrelated genes.

### Profile Plots

These plots reveal distinct expression patterns across different sample types, highlighting potential subtype-specific gene regulations in ACC.

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
[Insert Figure 2: GSEA Heatmap]

The GSEA results demonstrate significant enrichment of specific pathways in different modules across sample types, providing insights into the functional relevance of each module.

### Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)
[Insert Figures 3-8: ORA Bar Plots for Modules M1-M5 and Not Correlated Genes]

Key findings from ORA include:
- M1: Enriched in axon guidance and phosphorylation regulation
- M2: Strong association with neurotransmitter secretion and synaptic transmission
- M3: Enriched in immune response and inflammation-related processes
- M4: Involved in G-protein signaling and cell proliferation regulation
- M5: Heavily enriched in lipid and steroid metabolic processes

## Discussion of Enriched Pathways in ACC

The enriched pathways identified in our analysis provide intriguing insights into the biology of Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) and its subtypes:

1. **M1: Axon guidance and phosphorylation regulation**
   - Axon guidance pathways have been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. In ACC, these pathways may contribute to tumor invasion and spread (Chuang et al., 2017).
   - Dysregulation of phosphorylation is a hallmark of cancer, affecting cell signaling and proliferation. In ACC, aberrant phosphorylation has been linked to treatment resistance (Fassnacht et al., 2018).

2. **M2: Neurotransmitter secretion and synaptic transmission**
   - The enrichment of these pathways suggests a potential neuroendocrine component in ACC, particularly in certain subtypes. This aligns with studies showing neuroendocrine differentiation in a subset of ACCs, which may influence prognosis (Papotti et al., 2011).

3. **M3: Immune response and inflammation-related processes**
   - Immune and inflammatory processes play crucial roles in cancer development and progression. In ACC, the tumor microenvironment and immune infiltration have been shown to impact patient outcomes (Landwehr et al., 2020).

4. **M4: G-protein signaling and cell proliferation regulation**
   - G-protein signaling pathways are often dysregulated in cancer, including ACC. These pathways are involved in hormone signaling, a critical aspect of adrenal gland function and ACC pathogenesis (Else et al., 2014).
   - Aberrant cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer, and in ACC, it's associated with poor prognosis and aggressive subtypes like COC3 (Zheng et al., 2016).

5. **M5: Lipid and steroid metabolic processes**
   - Given the role of the adrenal gland in steroid hormone production, the enrichment of these pathways is particularly relevant to ACC. Alterations in steroid metabolism are characteristic of ACC and can distinguish it from adrenal adenomas (Kerkhofs et al., 2015).

### Interaction Network Analysis
[Insert Figures 9-13: Interaction Network Visualizations for Each Module]

These networks reveal key hub genes within each module, potentially identifying critical regulators in ACC pathogenesis:
- M1: UBC, EGFR, and MYC emerge as central hubs
- M2: UBC and MAP2 show high connectivity
- M3: UBC and COL1A1 are prominent hubs
- M4: JUN and JUNB display significant interactions
- M5: UBC and FASN are central to the network

## Significance of Hub Genes in ACC

The identified hub genes play critical roles in cancer biology and may have specific relevance to ACC:

1. **UBC (Ubiquitin C)**
   - Present as a hub in multiple modules, UBC is crucial for protein degradation and cellular stress response. In cancer, including ACC, ubiquitination processes are often dysregulated, affecting protein stability and signaling pathways (Gallo et al., 2016).

2. **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**
   - A well-known oncogene, EGFR overexpression has been observed in ACC and is associated with poor prognosis. It represents a potential therapeutic target, especially in aggressive subtypes like COC3 (Lacroix, 2015).

3. **MYC**
   - MYC amplification is common in ACC and correlates with poor outcomes. It's particularly relevant in the COC3 subtype, known for its aggressive behavior (Else et al., 2014).

4. **MAP2 (Microtubule Associated Protein 2)**
   - While primarily known for its role in neuronal function, MAP2 has been implicated in cancer cell migration and invasion. Its significance in ACC, particularly in relation to the enriched neurological pathways, warrants further investigation (Maximov et al., 2018).

5. **COL1A1 (Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain)**
   - Involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, COL1A1 has been associated with tumor invasion and metastasis in various cancers. Its role as a hub gene in ACC suggests potential involvement in tumor progression and metastasis (Zheng et al., 2018).

6. **JUN and JUNB**
   - These transcription factors are involved in cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Their activation has been linked to steroidogenesis in adrenocortical cells and may play a role in ACC development and progression (Drelon et al., 2016).

7. **FASN (Fatty Acid Synthase)**
   - FASN is often upregulated in cancer, supporting the high lipid demand of rapidly proliferating cells. In ACC, FASN overexpression has been observed and may contribute to the lipogenic phenotype of these tumors (Zimmerman et al., 2018).

## Key Findings and Implications

1. **Subtype-Specific Gene Regulation**: The distinct expression patterns across ACC subtypes suggest potential for targeted therapeutic approaches.

2. **Neurological Connections**: Strong enrichment of neurological processes in M2 hints at a potential neuroendocrine component in ACC, warranting further investigation.

3. **Immune System Involvement**: M3's enrichment in immune-related processes underscores the importance of the tumor microenvironment in ACC progression.

4. **Metabolic Reprogramming**: The significant enrichment of lipid and steroid metabolism in M5 aligns with the endocrine nature of ACC and suggests potential metabolic vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited.

5. **Hub Genes as Therapeutic Targets**: The identification of central hub genes like UBC, EGFR, and MYC provides promising avenues for targeted therapy development.

## Future Directions

1. Functional validation of key hub genes in ACC cell lines and animal models.
2. Integration of multi-omics data (e.g., methylation, copy number variation) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of ACC biology.
3. Exploration of the identified pathways for potential drug repurposing opportunities in ACC treatment.
4. Investigation of the neuroendocrine aspects of ACC, as suggested by the enrichment of neurological processes.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive gene co-expression network analysis in ACC has unveiled novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of this rare and aggressive cancer. By identifying distinct gene modules and their associated biological processes, we have paved the way for more targeted research approaches and potential therapeutic strategies. The integration of TCGA and GTEx data has provided a robust framework for understanding ACC in the context of normal adrenal tissue, offering a valuable resource for the scientific community engaged in adrenal cancer research.
